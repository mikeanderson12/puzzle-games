### Browser Compatibility

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist UI**: Clean interfaces that focus on gameplay
- **Consistent Experience**: Similar controls and layouts across all games
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for user actions and game states
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard support and clear visual cues

## How It Works

All games are **client-side applications** that run entirely in your browser:

1. **No servers**: Everything runs locally in your browser
2. **No processes**: Games only run when the page is open
3. **Local storage only**: High scores and preferences are saved in browser storage
4. **Closing the browser stops everything**: No background processes continue

### Data Storage
- High scores are saved using browser `localStorage`
- No personal data is collected or transmitted
- Data persists between sessions but stays on your device

## Controls

Each game has its own control scheme, but common patterns include:
- **Mouse/Touch**: Click or tap to interact
- **Keyboard**: Number keys, arrow keys, or specific shortcuts
- **Buttons**: On-screen controls for all actions

## Individual Game Documentation

Each game has its own detailed README with:
- Complete rules and objectives
- Control instructions
- Strategy tips
- Technical implementation details

Check each game's folder for its specific README.
